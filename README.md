### Hi threre ! 👋

I'm Sifex, a 20-year-old French-Russian developer based in Paris, with a passion for coding and a diverse programming journey. Over the last five years, I've honed my skills and experiences, and now I'm embarking on an exciting journey into blockchain development.

## About Me

- 🇫🇷🇷🇺 **Background**: Hailing from both French and Russian heritage, I've been immersed in two rich cultures that have influenced my approach to problem-solving and creativity.

- 💻 **Programming Skills**: My primary programming languages are C, C++, and Python. I've dedicated myself to mastering these languages, enabling me to take on a wide array of coding challenges. I've also had the opportunity to apply my coding skills during my high school years, where my consistently high grades reflected my proficiency and passion for programming. I excelled in my exams, thanks to my solid foundation and skill in coding.

- 🌐 **Web Development**: In addition to low-level programming, I've also ventured into web development using PHP, HTML, and JavaScript. I believe in being a well-rounded developer. Furthermore, I've built APIs and database systems for my programs, enhancing their functionality and interactivity, and ensuring a robust user experience.

## My Coding Journey

My coding journey has been a remarkable one:

- 🚀 **Hacking Adventures**: I embarked on my programming journey with a hacking mindset at the age of 13-14, delving into the intricacies of cybersecurity. By the time I was 15-16, I had mastered a wide array of skills in this domain. While I initially explored unconventional activities like hacking websites and individuals, it was this early exploration that ignited my passion for coding. Eventually, I redirected my focus, channeling my passion into the world of software development.

- 🎮 **Game Cheats**: During this period, I honed my coding skills by crafting sophisticated and undetectable cheat software for video games. These cheats not only provided players with a competitive edge but also came with a sleek and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). My primary goal was to develop high-quality, effective cheats that were not easily detected, which I could then sell to gamers seeking an advantage in their favorite titles. This experience significantly sharpened my programming prowess.

- 🤖 **Efficiency Bots**: I ventured into automation by developing highly efficient bots. One notable project was a sneaker purchasing bot, designed to secure limited-edition sneakers for resale. Additionally, I've also explored bot automation for purchasing items like PS5 consoles and concert tickets, all with the intent to resell them for profit. This experience allowed me to combine my coding skills with entrepreneurial instincts, further broadening my expertise in automation and efficiency.

- 🌐 **Blockchain Learning**: Currently, I'm diving into the world of blockchain development. My goal is to leverage blockchain technology to create innovative solutions. 

## My GitHub Presence

I'm relatively new to GitHub, so you won't find many commits in my history. While some of my projects will be open source and available for public collaboration, others will remain private. GitHub serves as both my portfolio and cloud repository for my projects, allowing me to showcase my work and collaborate with fellow developers when the opportunity arises.
